Together with `vale`, good text linters are:

- `write-good`
- `alex`
- `proselint`

Another highly customizable text linter is `textlint`, but being Japanese-made and having bad grammar in it's documentation it seems unprofessional. Maybe even like it is made by incompetent people.

On the other hand, `textlint` has extensive plugin system, that could be used as a inspiration to improve on existing `vale` rules, or to add new `vale` rules based on `textlint` plugins. Also, `textlint` should be able to support text in `org` format.
