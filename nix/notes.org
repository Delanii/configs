* Updating system

** Update configuration file

*** Update overlays

1. Update the package revision (git commit).
2. Remove the hash value.
3. The next rebuild errors out and prints the expected hash value. Copy the has value into the overlay.
4. Next build should finish OK.

** Commands to run

- if you want to just update the system, run

  #+begin_src shell
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#username --print-build-logs
  #+end_src

  This rebuilds the system for user =username= and also prints build information in the terminal. Everything is printed on one line if the switch =--print-build-logs= is not used.

- if you want to also update the flake inputs, run

  #+begin_src shell
  nix flake update
  #+end_src
