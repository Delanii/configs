* Updating system

** Update configuration file

** Commands to run

- if you want to just update the system, run

  #+begin_src shell
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#username --print-build-logs
  #+end_src

  This rebuilds the system for user =username= and also prints build information in the terminal. Everythink is printed on one line if the switch =--print-build-logs= is not used.

- if you want to also update the flake inputs, run

  #+begin_src shell
  nix flake update
  #+end_src
